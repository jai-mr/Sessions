<b>Assignment-03</b>

1. **Add "per step logging" (training step), and log "hp_metric" in tensorboard as validation loss**

- Please refer to https://github.com/jai-mr/Sessions/blob/main/Session03/README.md

2. **Do a Hyperparam sweep for CIFAR10 dataset with resnet18 from timm**

- Please refer to https://github.com/jai-mr/Sessions/blob/main/Session03
- Best Results are stored at https://github.com/jai-mr/Sessions/blob/main/Session03/optimization_results.yaml

3. **Push model, logs and data to google drive (using dvc)**

- Please refer to - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10MdcuWKsfDLtQPp1UeNJsrQLf3KL8hER?usp=sharing


4. **Push the pytorch lightning - hydra template with the dvc changes that we made to github**

- Please refer to https://github.com/jai-mr/Sessions/blob/main/Session03/

Jupyter Notebook
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ro7kyrM8gBb_5lLhfjT_q12rg6PGHmUr?usp=sharing
- Same file is uploaded in github location as well. Path - https://github.com/jai-mr/Sessions/blob/main/Session03/S3_Asgn3.ipynb

- Please note that I did not create pipeline for DVC. Rather I did those things manually in jupyter notebook.
- Github is not setup properly for me and hence used "dvc init --no-scm". 
- All the files for DVC are stored in the google drive and I was able to restore those as well.

5. **Upload Tensorboard logs to (https://tensorboard.dev/) and share link to the tensorboard.dev**

- Please refer to https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/Z75EVrieS8yaxRiekAbWgQ/#scalars
